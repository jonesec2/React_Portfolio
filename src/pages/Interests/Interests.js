            <p>I am eager to learn new skills, to further my career,
            but also use coding to express myself artistically. I am inspired by my hobbies; videogames, movies,
            Dungeons
            and Dragons, and books. I can't wait to use my new skills to create a website for my D&D group, or make a
               server to track books on my "to read" list.</p>
