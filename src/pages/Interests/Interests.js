        <p>I am eager to learn new skills, to further my career,
          but also use coding to express myself artistically. I am inspired by my hobbies; videogames, movies, Dungeons
          and Dragons, and books. I can't wait to use my new skills to create a website for my D&D group, or make a server to track books on my "to read" list.</p>
